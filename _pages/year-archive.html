There was a period of time where I blogged, and perhaps I will again.  I keep
whatever posts I have around for archival purposes, mostly.  The post at the top
contains links to the resources that are most commonly referenced or useful for
others (students etc).

{% include base_path %}
{% capture written_year %}'None'{% endcapture %}
{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}
  {% if year != written_year %}
    <h2 id="{{ year | slugify }}" class="archive__subtitle">{{ year }}</h2>
    {% capture written_year %}{{ year }}{% endcapture %}
  {% endif %}
  {% include archive-single.html %}
{% endfor %}
