I am an Associate Professor in the [School of Computer
Science](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon
University](http://www.cmu.edu/), primarily affiliated with the [Software and
Societal Systems Department](https://s3d.cs.cmu.edu) (formerly known as the Institute for
Software Research). My research interests span software engineering and
programming languages, and especially in how to construct, maintain, evolve,
improve/debug, and assure high-quality software systems. My group of brilliant
students and collaborators is called [squaresLab](http://squareslab.github.io/). I [teach](/teaching.html) software engineering
and program analysis at the undergraduate, masters, and PhD levels and co-direct
the [REUSE@CMU](http://reuse.cs.cmu.edu/) summer program.
Students or potential students interested in working with me can learn more [here.](/advising.html)

**Meeting with me:** Your best bet in setting up a meeting is to email me while CCing Kelsey Marziale (kmarzial@andrew.cmu.edu).  If you want to propose some times (always helpful!), [my calendar is available](/calendar.html).

**Relevant trivia:** My last name is pronounced “Le-Gwess.”
