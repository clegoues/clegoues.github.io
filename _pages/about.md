**I am:** an Associate Professor in the [School of Computer
Science](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon
University](http://www.cmu.edu/), primarily affiliated with the [Institute for
Software Research](http://www.isri.cmu.edu/). My research interests span software engineering and
programming languages, and especially in how to construct, maintain, evolve,
improve/debug, and assure high-quality software systems. My group of brilliant
students and collaborators is called [squaresLab](http://squareslab.github.io/). I teach software engineering
and program analysis at the undergraduate, masters, and PhD levels and co-direct
the [REUSE@CMU](http://reuse.cs.cmu.edu/) summer program.

If you’re interested in research in applied program analysis for improving and
reasoning about software quality, apply to the [CMU PhD in Software Engineering!](http://se-phd.isri.cmu.edu/)

**Relevant trivia:** My last name is pronounced “Le-Gwess.”
