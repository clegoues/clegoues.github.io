There was a period of time where I blogged, and perhaps I will again.  I keep
whatever posts I have around for archival purposes, mostly.  Here are a few
things/resources that are useful to point to at a top level:

- [The CS Grad Job and Interview Guide](https://csguides.github.io/grad-job-guide/), which has lived and proven
  useful for far longer than I ever expected it to! Includes additions and new
  perspectives since my own search in 2013, including on the SLAC market and
  industry research positions.

- [CLG Paper Writing Guidelines](/posts/clg-writing-rules.html) Are you a student
  writing a paper with me? Read this, save us some time! 

- [Anonymous Review at
  SSBSE](/posts/ssbse-anon-review.html): Back
  in 2014 Shin Yoo and I experimented with anonymous review when we chaired
  SSBSE, and wrote a blog post explaining why.  Some people have found it
  useful, though it is now of course getting a bit old (aren't we all!).
  I'm pleased to note that anonymous review has since become the standard at Software
  Engineering venues.
