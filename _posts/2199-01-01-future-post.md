There was a period of time where I blogged, and perhaps I will again.  I keep
whatever posts I have around for archival purposes, mostly.  Here are a few
things/resources that are useful to point to at a top level:

- [The CS Grad Job and Interview Guide](https://csguides.github.io/grad-job-guide/), which has lived and proven
  useful for far longer than I ever expected it to! Includes additions and new
  perspectives since my own search in 2013, including on the SLAC market and
  industry research positions.
