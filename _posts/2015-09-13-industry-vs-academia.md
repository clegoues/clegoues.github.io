[Emery](http://emeryberger.com/) peer pressured me to blog, presumably rather than ranting entirely in Facebook posts, which is where a moderately shorter version of this first appeared. I admit this does feel a hair more legitimate. At least, I feel less compelled to apologize for the length.)

This article:
[Uber Would Like to Buy Your Robotics Department (NYTimes)](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/magazine/uber-would-like-to-buy-your-robotics-department.html)

...is frustrating. To the best of my (limited) knowledge, it more or less
accurately represents the facts of the Uber-CMU-NREC deal (and is notably less
inflammatory than early reporting on the subject), and yet still totally misses
the point: 

To start, it treats an event that it acknowledges was both foreseeable and
anomalous (i.e., the NREC staff were already eyeing the private sector; everyone
was surprised at the scale of the hire) as indicative of a trend.

More importantly, while it does sort of acknowledge the benefits to Pittsburgh,
it mostly just conflates Pittsburgh/CMU with Silicon Valley/Stanford, which is
rote nonsense for reasons that would take at least another several blog posts to
explain. Setting aside concerns about Uber's management, this is mostly just a
good thing for Pittsburgh, a town with a real estate surplus and remarkably
healthy town/gown/tech relations (...I doubt it would be nearly so positive for
SV).

Anecdata: Note long after the technology center was first announced, *an
actual Uber driver* said to me that, even though the goal is to eliminate
his job: "...but that's years away, and something like that is great for the
city."


It's the same story with Google, which only gets a passing (though again,
accurate!) reference: Andrew Moore did leave CMU for Google. He then built a
multi-hundred-person <a href="#one" name="backtoone">[1]</a> satellite lab in
PGH that is substantively contributing to the revitalization (...ignoring issues
of gentrification for the purposes of this discussion) of the East End.

AND THEN HE CAME BACK.

One datapoint, but still: Individual faculty members leaving for industry isn't
really the problem (Maybe it's worse in CA?). The real issue, which the article
doesn't touch on at all, is the draw on students. Why engage in a summer
research project for $15 an hour when you can make $20k interning at Facebook?
No research experience--&gt;no exposure to research as a career option, and a
weak grad school application. And why bother, frankly, when fbook converts the
internship into a $100k+ offer for a fresh BA/BS?

(We're also probably the only field in the history of academia to have such a
surfeit of grad students who want to be professors, no matter what it feels like
from the job search side. This doesn't bother me much, though, since they at
least give research a fair shake.)

Lest this sound like First World Problems, let's return to the elided benefits
to the city and think about how deeply positive this story really is: Taxpayer
funded pie-in-the-sky ML and robotics research turn, over 20-30 years, into
Google labs and advanced technology centers in a beautiful, vibrant city that by
all rights should have collapsed with the steel industry, but didn't.
*University research creates jobs*. Sustained public investment in levels
1-4 research, which the private sector increasingly does *not* fund, is
fundamental to the US economy and technological success.

We need to improve the way we, academics, communicate that fact to the public, since politicians are conveniently ignorant of what we do all day ([LOOKING AT YOU WISCONSIN](http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevensalzberg/2015/08/14/scott-walker-takes-250-million-from-u-wisconsin-gives-250m-to-billionaire-sports-team-owners/))

Upshot: rather than a "woe is CMU" story, why can't someone write a "good job,
NSF/NASA/DARPA" story? I'm not that close to the situation, being neither a
roboticist nor, like, the Dean, but that's more my sense of the sentiment on the
ground, for whatever that's worth. And also: The tech boom may be posing a risk
to academic computer science, but probably not through the acquisition and
commercialization of industry-ready technologies.

actually totally made up that number, which is probably cool for Facebook but
maybe misleading in the legitimacy of a blog post.<a href="#backtoone">^</a>
