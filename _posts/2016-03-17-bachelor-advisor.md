Two of my  ongoing professional quests are to provide insight the processes of
CS academia to those who would benefit from it and to increase the number of
people who meet me and say "Oh, I know about you!  <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jyang2/">Jean Yang</a> mentioned you on <a
href="http://jxyzabc.blogspot.com/">her blog</a>!"  To those ends, over at her
blog, Jean and I <a
href="http://jxyzabc.blogspot.com/2016/03/what-bachelor-teaches-us-about-choosing.html">collaborated
on some advice to prospective CS PhD students</a> choosing between potential
advisors, with lessons from our favorite reality TV show.
