It's summer conference time, and Phil Guo recently posted a handy how-to on "<a href="http://pgbovine.net/attending-conferences.htm">Attending Professional Conferences as a Newcomer</a>", which reminded me to finish this one up. His post is probably more actionable; here, I elaborate on a related piece of advice in a way that&nbsp;is hopefully complementary.&nbsp;<span id="selectionBoundary_1494784153446_23183101071139833" class="rangySelectionBoundary" style="line-height:0;display:none;"></span>

tl;dr: My basic advice for students on conference networking is&nbsp;<em>Don't obsess about meeting/impressing/talking to anyone in particular about anything in particular. &nbsp;Just&nbsp;talk to people with whom you have something&nbsp;to talk about.</em> <em>&nbsp;</em>

Especially at first, this primarily means talking to other&nbsp;students. You have more in common and they're easier to talk to,&nbsp;and so hanging out or hashing out&nbsp;ideas together is reasonable/fun.

"But, Claire! I'm supposed to meet and impress Senior Famous&nbsp;People!"

Sure, visibility is important, particularly&nbsp;when looking for a job or promotion (when the assistance/support of more senior community members matter especially). &nbsp; However, job <em>acquisition</em>&nbsp;is only one&nbsp;element&nbsp;of a professional scientific career. The connections/friendships that contribute to&nbsp;job <em>execution</em>&nbsp;are random, fluid, impossible to&nbsp;predict, and not even remotely limited to senior colleagues. Here are&nbsp;several&nbsp;stories about my (n=1) life:
<ol>
	<li>Summer, 2004. IBM Research, Hawthorne, NY. I'm 19, at my first software engineering internship (which I don't deserve, but that's a different story). &nbsp;I share a large utility closet ("office") with a PhD student (who, for the record, does deserve his internship). &nbsp;13 years later,&nbsp;<em>my</em> graduate students are&nbsp;interning with that guy, <a href="http://davidshepherd.weebly.com/">David Shepherd</a>, now a Senior Principal&nbsp;Scientist at <a href="http://www.abb.com/">ABB</a>. &nbsp;I also keep <a href="https://twitter.com/clegoues/status/852867754537476097">trying to get into flamewars with him on Twitter and failing</a>.</li>
	<li>March, 2009. ETAPS, York, UK. I'm a second-year graduate student attending, alone, my&nbsp;first conference. &nbsp;One night, a bunch of&nbsp;students go out to dinner at an offbeat vegetarian restaurant where we all sit on the floor.&nbsp;The leader of that dinner expedition was <a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/CaitlinSadowski.html">Caitlin Sadowski</a>, who later became my contact for my Google Faculty award.</li>
	<li>Summer, 2009. Microsoft Research, Redmond. &nbsp;A&nbsp;fellow intern comes around the floor with&nbsp;a bag&nbsp;of cookies he'd baked with his daughter the night before. We bond over cookies and also how&nbsp;angry we both get about the abuse&nbsp;of&nbsp;statistics in empirical SE. &nbsp;He is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cbird/">Chris Bird</a>, now a&nbsp;full time MSR researcher, and a friend. We hang out at conferences, host one another for talks, and go out to Resident Evil movies with <a href="http://thomas-zimmermann.com/">Tom Zimmerman</a> (...also a different story).</li>
	<li>November, 2010. FSE, Santa Fe. Chris&nbsp;introduces me to some of his&nbsp;friends, one of whom&nbsp;opens with "Hi, I know who you&nbsp;are. I just wrote a paper about how you're wrong." He's&nbsp;<a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~brun/">Yuriy Brun</a>, a post doc at the time,&nbsp;UMass-Amherst faculty now. &nbsp;We're 4+ papers and an NSF Medium into a pretend-contentious but mostly genuinely productive/fun collaboration.</li>
	<li>November, 2012. FSE, Raleigh. Yuriy introduces me to <a href="https://kstolee.github.io/">Katie Stolee</a>, also on the job market at the time. She's now faculty at NCSU, a collaborator (the third PI on that 3-PI NSF Medium!) and a friend. &nbsp;We joke she will name all her children after me.</li>
</ol>
I have more stories like this. &nbsp;You get the idea.&nbsp;I talked to these people because they're smart, interesting, and funny, and we had&nbsp;something&nbsp;to talk about, not because I thought they'd eventually hire my students. &nbsp;Thus are both friendships and collaborations born.

The&nbsp;FOMO can be real: "Should I stop talking&nbsp;to this grad student and approach that famous person for no reason?" My advice is, fundamentally: probably not. Chill out. Your peers&nbsp;remain&nbsp;your peers. &nbsp;I had no idea that any of&nbsp;those initial conversations would lead to, well, anything, and that's not why I had them; yet, here we are.

I'm also not saying "don't talk to senior&nbsp;people." &nbsp;My point is just that relationships are established&nbsp;via&nbsp;conversation/idea exchange beyond simple introductions. &nbsp;One more (n=1) story about a Very Important Conversation&nbsp;with&nbsp;a senior faculty member:

6. June, 2012. &nbsp;ICSE, Zurich. I give a talk. One of the post-talk questioners is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Jean_Harrold">Mary Jean Harrold</a>, a professor&nbsp;at&nbsp;Georgia Tech who has since, sadly, passed&nbsp;away, <em>much&nbsp;</em>too soon. &nbsp;I don't remember the question, but I <em>do</em> remember both that it was interesting and that I fumbled the answer. At the next&nbsp;break,&nbsp;I steeled my nerves (she was intimidating!) and approached&nbsp;her, saying, "Dr. Harrold, your question was interesting, and I&nbsp;answered it&nbsp;badly. Do you have a moment? I'd like to try again." &nbsp;I must not have been too much of a disaster the second time around, because she eventually asked if I was on the job market, suggesting I apply to Georgia Tech.

However, the moral here&nbsp;is more than&nbsp;"I talked to&nbsp;a senior&nbsp;person and then&nbsp;interviewed at a fancy department." Life is&nbsp;not, fundamentally, about operationalizing human&nbsp;connections (...honestly the whole idea of "networking" puts me a little on edge). Mary Jean acted as a mentor throughout my GTech interview process. She was a force of nature, and I was lucky to spend even a small amount of time interacting with her. Even in that initial conversation, the fact that she took me seriously helped me, in a small but important way, take&nbsp;<em><em>myself</em>&nbsp;</em>a bit more&nbsp;seriously as a job candidate. <em>&nbsp;</em>Overall,&nbsp;a random conference conversation with a senior person ended up positively affecting my life, well beyond any kind of&nbsp;immediate job-related outcome.

But! Moral time! If I'd gone into it thinking "I should talk&nbsp;to X random&nbsp;senior person and try to impress her into interviewing me!", I suspect it would have gone badly, if only because I'd have been too nervous to say anything&nbsp;<em>remotely&nbsp;</em>reasonable.&nbsp;I approached her because&nbsp;she was an interesting, smart person who had&nbsp;asked me an interesting question, and I wanted to talk to her about&nbsp;it.

So: don't put pressure on yourself to talk to particular types of people about particular subjects. &nbsp;Talk to people if you want to, or make friends if you want to, or don't. &nbsp;You're not doing it wrong.
